Measure classification error now that benchmarking is done after weight updates and before regularisation

Improve vanishing gradient cirumvention by averaging real gradients *then* normalising their magnitudes

Investigate effect of momentum

Combine regularisation and weight update steps

Don't clip weights. Normalising the contrast has the same effect
